// Some background info on GCD and LCM.
// Let's say for simplicities sake we only have 2 animations a and b,
// with length 12 and 18:

a = 12
b = 18

// And we want to calculate after how many frames they both repeat.
// This is called calculating the LCM -> LOWEST COMMON MULTIPLE
// Which is 36 in this case 
// (which is not that hard to see if you draw it out as centimeters for example,
//  after 36 units, both a repeats and b repeats at the same point/distance in time)

// But what if the numbers are more complex? Or if we have multiple numbers?
// For this we need to understand two terms:
// - the GCD = GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR
//   (the biggest number that can divide both)
// - the LCM = LOWEST COMMON MULTIPLE
//   (the smallest number divisible by both)

// Conceptually I find the GCD easiest to understand: 
// - write both numbers as a multiplication of primes:
// a = 2 * 2 * 3
// b = 2 * 3 * 3

// Then look at the biggest matching part -> 2 * 3
// So the GCD = 6

// Now the LOWEST COMMON MULTIPLE ...
// One common multiple is a * b = 12 * 18 (= 216)
// but that is not the lowest...

// Because 12 can be divided by 6 and 18 can be divided by 6
// (2 * 2 * 3) * (2 * 3 * 3) = 2 * (2 * 3) * 3 * (2 * 3)
// The 2 * (2 * 3) and (2 * 3) * 3 are already in there so to speak,
// so we can undo the last (2 * 3) which is the GCD:

// In other words the LCM(a,b) = (a * b) / GCD (a, b)
// (For an official proof see some unreadable wiki pages)

// For multiple numbers, we need to take it in steps, e.g. for:
// a = 4  
// b = 6
// c = 8

// We need to do LCM(a,b,c) = LCM (LCM(a,b), c)
// which comes down to:
// LCM(a,b) = 4 * 6 / GDC(4,6) = 24 / 2 = 12
// LCM(12, c) = 12 * c / GDC(12,c) = 12 * 8 / 4 = 96 / 4 = 24
